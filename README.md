# Introduction
================

This repository contains a series of exercises to help you learn and practice Go programming. 
Each exercise is self-contained and includes instructions, examples, and tests to guide you through the task.

# Installation
--------------

To run these exercises, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Cloning the Repository
--------------------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-exercises.git
cd golang-exercises
```

### Working Locally
-------------------

To solve an exercise on your local machine, you first need to install and configure the Exercism Command Line Interface (CLI) using these instructions.
```Bash
exercism configure --token=<your-api-token>
```

```Bash
exercism download --exercise=<exercise-slug> --track=<track-slug>
```
### Solving the Exercise
------------------------

The goal of each exercise is to create an implementation that passes all the tests. Each exercise contains the following files:
 - README.md: instructions explaining what is expected of you
 - HELP.md: information on how to run the tests and get help when you're stuck
 - HINTS.md (optional): hints to help solve the exercise
 - Test file(s): contain the tests that verify your solution's correctness
 - Stub file(s): provide a starting point to help you get started with building your implementation

### Submitting your Solution
---------------------------

Once your solution passes all the tests, you can submit your solution using the following command:
```Bash
exercism submit <implementation_file_paths>
````

### Other CLI Functionality
---------------------------

 - exercism help: get the full list of available commands
 - exercism version: verify which version you are on
 - exercism troubleshoot: troubleshoot any issues
