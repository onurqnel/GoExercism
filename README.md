## Installation

To run these exercises, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-exercises.git
cd golang-exercises
```

### Working Locally

To solve an exercise on your local machine, you first need to install and configure the Exercism Command Line Interface (CLI) using these instructions.
```Bash
exercism configure --token=<your-api-token>
```

```Bash
exercism download --exercise=<exercise-slug> --track=<track-slug>
```

### Solving the Exercise

The goal of each exercise is to create an implementation that passes all the tests. Each exercise contains the following files:
 - README.md: instructions explaining what is expected of you
 - HELP.md: information on how to run the tests and get help when you're stuck
 - HINTS.md (optional): hints to help solve the exercise
 - Test file(s): contain the tests that verify your solution's correctness
 - Stub file(s): provide a starting point to help you get started with building your implementation

### Submitting your Solution

Once your solution passes all the tests, you can submit your solution using the following command:
```Bash
exercism submit <implementation_file_paths>
````

### Other CLI Functionalities
 - completion   Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
 - configure    Configure the command-line client.
 - download     Download an exercise.
 - help         Help about any command
 - open         Open an exercise on the website.
 - prepare      Prepare does setup for Exercism and its tracks.
 - submit       Submit your solution to an exercise.
 - test         Run the exercise's tests.
 - troubleshoot Troubleshoot does a diagnostic self-check.
 - upgrade      Upgrade to the latest version of the CLI.
 - version      Version outputs the version of CLI.
 - workspace    Print out the path to your Exercism workspace.
